PDXC Framework is a simple blog theme designed to be used as a foundation for other themes.
 
== Description ==
PDXC Framework was developed out of a sense of frustration with other frameworks and a lack 
of understanding into how the various classes and id's interact. In short, things were not 
lining up the way they should and weird things would happen at some resolutions but not 
others. This framework was designed and developed from the ground up to be simple to use. It 
can be used as a parent for a child theme, or expanded upon to create a more robust theme. 
Development was done with a mobile first mentality and the code has been heavily commented so 
there should be plenty of clarity as to what things are doing.
 
 ==Development Notes==
 The following was taken into consideration as this theme was being developed:
 *The theme should look as good on a small screen as it does on a larger one.
 *The SCSS file was sectioned off and all class and id names are descriptive, so it should be 
 obvious what things do and where they go.
